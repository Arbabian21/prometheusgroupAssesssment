I was gonna make a front end for this assesment but the project didn't require it and 
I recall that in my previous interview with Brian, he was more so interested in my 
exposure to dotnet and backend work- thus i decided to only focus on having as good 
of a back end implementation as possible. It was not easy as I had to google a lot of 
basic dotnet stuff. I'm not sure what some of these libraries are doing under the hood 
but throwing in a few import (using) lines and some copy paste configuration allowed me 
to focus on my implementation and learning of the Model, Service, Controller Architecture 
as well as the whole abstraction and implementation of interfaces to allow for dependency 
injection.
